\title{Word cloud summaries of GO enrichment analysis}
\description{
  A package to visualize Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment
  analysis results on gene lists arising from different
  analyses such clustering or PCA. The significant GO
  categories are visualised as word clouds that can be
  combined with different plots summarizing the underlying
  data.
}
\details{
  The goal of GOsummaries package is to draw figures that
  can be used in presentations and articles. To draw them,
  the user should first construct a
  \code{\link{gosummaries}} object and then use its plot
  function on it. One can start constructing the
  \code{\link{gosummaries}} object from gene lists, with
  filling in all the necessary information step by step.
  However, there are some convenience functions for
  different classes of common analysis results. See
  \code{\link{gosummaries.kmeans}},
  \code{\link{gosummaries.MArrayLM}} and
  \code{\link{gosummaries.prcomp}} corresponding to
  k-means, limma and PCA results.

  The \code{\link{plot.gosummaries}} describes how to
  customize the plots.

  The word cloud drawing function
  \code{\link{plotWordcloud}} in this package is
  implemented largely based on the code from package
  \code{wordcloud}, but with slight tweaks: it uses
  \code{grid} graphics, has some additional layout options,
  has more intelligent options to scale the text sizes to
  fit the picture and, finally, should be a bit faster
  since larger part of the algorithm was implemeted in C++.
